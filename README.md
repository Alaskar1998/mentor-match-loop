# Maharat Hub - Premium Upgrade System

This guide explains how the premium upgrade system works for Maharat Hub.

## Overview

The current implementation uses a simple upgrade request system that:

- âœ… **Collects user requests** - Users can request premium upgrades
- âœ… **Admin dashboard** - Admins can view and manage upgrade requests
